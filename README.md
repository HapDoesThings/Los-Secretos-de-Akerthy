# Los-Secretos-de-Akerthy
This is a demo of a 2D platform game a colleague and I had to make for class.
The game is not finished and might not be anytime in the future but it was a fun project where I could apply what I learned the months before. We even did a GDD and everything!!

When it comes to organising the workload I personally used a GTD method to keep up with the project. I would have used tools like Trello, but since we had a Gantt Chart she refused to use them.

As to programming I did most of the game and revised some other parts.
My parts were:
- Ashura's movement and animations
- Enemy movement and animations
- Platforms
- Object and collision interactions
- Live and damage counters

The code I revised was:
- Dialogue flow and interaction
- Menus
- Scene changes

I also linked most of the things in Unity and although it is not as clean as I'd like it to, working with a partner that doesn't know how to program can be a bit hard. This project showed me how important organisation can be and that things should be revised periodically.

I might update it in a future or maybe it will fall into the "won't-be-touched-again" chest, who knows...
